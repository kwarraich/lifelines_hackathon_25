## Crisis Management - CPS#6: Shelter and Displacement Management

### Introduction
Mawaa is designed to tackle the global crisis of displacement and insufficient shelter availability by facilitating efficient communication and resource sharing between aid organizations and providing direct assistance to displaced individuals. This project harnesses technology to streamline shelter management and displacement response efforts.

### Theory of Innovation
Abraham Maslow identified shelter as a basic human need, yet, decades later, the challenge of providing adequate shelter in crisis situations remains. With displacement numbers growing dramatically, the development of technological solutions like Mawaa has become crucial. Our software aims to address these issues through innovative, technology-driven responses that can adapt to the unique challenges presented by different crisis environments.

### Software Solution
Mawaa consists of two interlinked components:
1. **Organizational Interface:** This backend tool enables aid organizations to maintain and update a shared database of resources and shelter availability, enhancing collaboration and resource distribution.
2. **Refugee Mobile App:** A mobile application that helps displaced individuals find nearby shelters that meet their needs, providing critical information directly to those who need it most.
